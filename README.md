# LEWB
The Loaded Engineering Work Bench
***

Project is in the idea stage at the moment. feel free to contribute thoughts and ideas!

## Requirements

- raised surface, capable of comfortably working in a standing position, or in on a high stool
- primary surfaces must be made of non-conductive materials
- Promote a static-free surface
- have variety of outlets for a wide variety of output voltages and current types
 - some outlets for standard barrel jacks and usb for power draw
 - each outlet can have power cut to it individually
 - master kill switch
 - programmable kill switches, to kill custom groupings of power sources
- well lit
- repel dust
- articulating keyboard tray
  full range of movement over/around/outside of primary work surface
 -min height above ground would be at a height of 6-8" below primary surface level
 - max height above ground, to 10-12" above primary surface level
- articulating monitor mount for flatpanel monitor (sized between 11"-32")
- built in mobo, proc, RAM, etc... capable of running commercial 64x Linux distro (4gb RAM, basic video drivers/gpu)
 - well ventilated/cooled
 - connections for peripherals and serial devices on a primary surface
- IoT enabled. the workbench itself (not the built in PC, or perhaps via the built in PC) should be an internet enabled device/network enabled device

 
 ## Design Ideas

- Hollow posts in back corners of primary surface acts as risers, and cable runners, and also can adapt a swivel mounted articulating arm system for keyboard/monitor/lights/magnifying glass/video camera mount
- a 2x8 from back corner to back corner would house various outlets, inputs/outputs
- a section on top of the "power row", perhaps 12" in height, 4"-6" in depth, as a recessed shell for portable storage of common electrical component organizers
 - back of this recessed "storage row" would contain LED backlighting, for hish visibility of parts i sliding trays
- remember those sliding chalkboards from school? what if storage compartments could be slid around like that to maximize available space?
- primary surface could be a strong platic, capable of being drawn on with dry erase markers
 - anti-static coating?
 - maybe micro-drilled like an air hocket table for air induction to keep parts from rolling off of surface?
- outer edge (last few centimeters of so) of primary surface could be adjastable in height, 
- 2-4 "breadboard lanes" running from front to back, flush with the surface, with powered breadboards laid into the surface
-  - essentially it could be a full network arduino substitue
 - could also be able to programmatically control things like LED backlighting for the parts shelves (make 'em blink when you want to find a certain part!), kill power to a power source/group, monitor temp/humidity in local environment
- a small TFT touch panel (the size of say a nav screen in modern car)
 - Runs Android? Displays Sensor output from temp/humidity/other built in sensors
 - can be paired to phone via bluetooth, and displays caller info (acts as bluetooth headset)
 - can be used to pair to remote maker bench's, for paired engineering, or for ability to exchange workbench firmata/sketches so you can reproduce circuits and custom killswitch setups easily
- built in mic/speakers (for IoT, calls, that kinda stuff)
